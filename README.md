Hey there 👋, I’m *Moss* – a cozy, curious coder learning to build things one mossy byte at a time. I love minimalist workflows, Linux tinkering, and creating clean, aesthetic setups to make coding a calm, enjoyable experience.

### 🌱 What I’m currently exploring:

* Building *web apps* with clean, modern stacks
* Learning *Linux internals & ricing workflows*
* Setting up *dotfiles* for a comfy dev environment
* Sharing my learning journey on *YouTube*

### 🛠️ Tech I’m using:

Arch Linux · Neovim · VS Code · Dart · Flutter · Python · Node.js

### ✨ Goals:

* Create open-source projects that feel cozy to use
* Share minimal aesthetic workflows to inspire others
* Build apps that help others learn calmly
* improve myself in the process
